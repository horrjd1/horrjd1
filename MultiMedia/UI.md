## Multi Media UI Assignment

### Tools

For this assignment I used Adobe Illustrator for the wireframes and Photoshop for the mock-ups.

The reason why I used Illustrator for the wireframes is because of how it manages its objects. Every shape placed on the page can be moved and resized separately even when they're on the same layer. Since Illustrator is a vector-based software the elements never lost any quality. This was useful for making the wireframes as I was moving and changing the elements on the page frequently.
